# Chess
Simple chess game written in C++ langauage, in object-oriented programming paradigm, for university project.

So far this app composes of back-end only, but still lacks some sort of rules for recognition on when should the game end. I am planning on adding those, as well as the GUI and maybe tidying up the code, it's way too rough now.
